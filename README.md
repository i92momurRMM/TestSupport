# sasw-test-support
Opinionated template for practicing TDD and write any unit, functional or integration test following a Given-When-Then approach.

The goal is to make tests more readable, in a standarized and consistent way, and to promote a deterministic and idempotent approach by encouraging
the configuration of preconditions and the execution outside the fact assertions.

The XUnit version supports asynchronous Given and When.

It targets `netstandard2.1` (it can be used with any version of .NET Core and .NET 5+)
